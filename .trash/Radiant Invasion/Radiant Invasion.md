The Radiant Invasion was an attempt by the Brightmother to regain control of what she had created after 4 million years of experimentation and observation. The Radiant Invasion began with Fa'vaesura's Hell Skirmishes in 1321, but it wouldn't be known as the Radiant Invasion until the invasion of Meria, which itself began in 1332.

###### Hell Skirmishes
Its original goal was to completely decimate the realm of Meria so that Fa'vaesura may perform her experimentations on a blank slate once more, but the initial plan would change upon Fa'vaesura realizing that the inhabitants of hell would interfere with her experimentations once more, like they did with Meria. In order to stop this, Fa'vaesura shifted her focus towards the realm of Hell and the kingdom of Ifnir.
