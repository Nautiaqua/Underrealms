The Radiant Invasion was an attempt by the Brightmother to regain control of what she had created after approximately 4 million years of experimentation and observation. The invasion would properly begin with the invasion of Hell in the year 1321, but it wouldn't be recognized as the Radiant Invasion until Meria was involved in 1332.

This event would last the span 2 decades—from the Hell Crusades in 1321, to Fa'vaesura's defeat in 1342. The Radiant Invasion would also mark a massive shift in the socioeconomic states of both Meria and Hell, as it would cause a massive socioeconomic paradigm shift with Meria, while Hell's Kingdom of Ifnir would nearly collapse—but fall under a new leader who aims to forge relations between Ifnir and Merian nations.
