Fa'vaesura's first foray into the realm of Hell would involve the Hell Crusades, a series of battles which occurred in the outer and inner circles of Hell. The Hell Crusades were both long and bloody, lasting over 21 years whilst having just over 1.6 billion casualties on both sides of the war.

##### Outer Hell Skirmishes
After discovering an undefended Hell Gate, the Hell Crusades would begin with the Outer Hell Skirmishes, taking place in the outermost layer of Hell: Itrinoch. A combination of Fa'vaesura's overconfidence and her lack of any strategic skill would lead to countless losses, with most of her uri'yir forces either being completely wiped out or heavily injured after the battles. Her attempts at an invasion would alert the kingdom of Ifnir, causing them to send out a small amount of reinforcements to the encampments that had been attacked.

After five months and three weeks of losses and intermittent victories, Fa'vaesura would begin revising her strategy, realizing that she lacked the skill to successfully replicate the strategic maneuvers that were used by the Merians in their wars. Instead, she'd begin relying on sheer numbers in order to overwhelm her opponents. She created the ura'nir (more commonly referred to as the brightspawn) to act as cannon fodder for her armies. This change in strategy would prove to be a success as many of the outposts that were defending the Hell Gates of Itrinoch would fall to Fa'vaesura's forces, providing her with more openings for her forces to enter Hell from.
