"The Underrealms, as the Brightmother once referred to them... A world as vast and as storied as this home of mine need not go unrecorded. I write this tome in hopes of preserving what I could in the case of a catastrophic event obliterating all that I once knew, or perhaps future generations, eons into the future, might be able to learn from these records if they ever manage to reach this lonesome tower of mine.

I shall be writing this tome intermittently and out of order—for this damned device of mine only allows me to see random brief glimpses of the past. But it matters not, my work shall continue evermore."
— *Memnie*
