_Despite their short stature, the dwarves are the strongest out of the three epochal species, and only a fool would dare underestimate them. Many dwarves could trace their lineage back to the Dwennar, and many of them carry the culture and traditions of the Dwennar wherever they go, hence the common perception of dwarves being skilled artisans and warriors._

###### **Origin**
Shortly after the creation of the elfeim, Fa'vaesura came to the realization that both the humans and the elfeim lacked the strength to create innovations at a larger scale, especially when she'd observed that the strongest humans were busy hunting and gathering food, rather than using their strength to assist with innovation. To possibly further accelerate progress, Fa'vaesura created the dwarves, a species that was meant to resemble humans, but were shorter and stronger. 

The dwarves were placed in Meria at the same time as the elfeim, but they were accepted by the humans sooner due their very human-like appearance. Many humans mistook them for children at first, but as time passed, they realized that the dwarves were a species completely different from them. It'd only take a few hundred years for the dwarves to start becoming the craftsmen of various tribes.
#### **Traits**
- **Lifespan**: 180 years old, average 170.
- **Height**: Adults stand up from 3’11 to 5’0.
- **Physiology**: One of the most defining features of a dwarf is their short average height, with most of them standing around 4'3. Despite their small stature, they're one of the strongest species due to their increased muscle strength, able to lift and carry double their weight (even without any training). Their bodies are also more susceptible to the cold, experiencing hypothermia faster at lower temperatures. On the other hand though, they’re more resilient to heat, but that doesn’t mean their bodies are entirely fireproof or heatproof.
