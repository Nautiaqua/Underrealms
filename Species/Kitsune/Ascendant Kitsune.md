_A powerful kitsune bearing a part of Inari's soul. The ascended kitsune are deified and are made the leaders of Kitsune society due to their innate power and incredibly long lifespan. A fool would be led to believe that ascension as a kitsune requires naught but luck, but in truth, only those who are deemed worthy are chosen by Inari._

###### **Origin**
A few days before his passing, Inari would cast a spell that'd split his soul into two halves upon his passing. One of these halves would reside around the Sacred Sakura, waiting for a worthy successor to take on his soul.

30 years Inari's passing, his soul which orbited the Sacred Sakura would possess its first successor; a kitsune only known by the name of Fujiwara. 
###### **Traits**
- **Lifespan**: 1000 years, 1000 average.
- **Height**: 5'0 to 6'5.
- **Physiology**: The ascendant kitsune have the same features as a normal kitsune, the only difference being their ability to gain a maximum of nine tails due to their long lifespan. They are also ageless and able to change their age to whatever they wishâ€”they could be eternally youthful, or take on the appearance of a wise elder.
  
  Upon reaching the age of 1000, the ascendant kitsune begin to harness enough mana within their bodies to the point where they become so unstable and volatile that they'd explode. To prevent this, they'd have to perform a ritual to sacrifice themselves to the Sacred Sakura.
