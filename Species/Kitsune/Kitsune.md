_Mysterious and reclusive, the kitsune are so rare that many believe them to be a myth from the eastern country of Seinaru Daichi. They tend to hide their ears and tails when interacting with other races, but some kitsune have forgone this tradition in the wake of acceptance by many people._

#### **Origin**
Kitsune were once other races that had undergone a transformation under the blessing of Inari. The first few kitsune were the most devoted of Inari's followers, and he transformed many of them through the consumption of a magical sake that Inari himself had created, slowly transforming them into a kitsune through magic. Later on, much more people would be privy to Inari's blessing as he infused a tree with a part of his soul. When drunk, the tree's sap would sometimes turn people into a kitsune, otherwise it did nothing.

Due to the Fey Hunts being instated by the Seinaru Daichi's old emperor, the kitsune were forced to become reclusive or else they'd be hunted and killed due being mistaken for being fey, thus resulting to their minimal numbers in modern times.

###### **Traits**
- **Lifespan**: 200 years, average of 190.
- **Height**: 5'0 to 6'5.
- **Physiology**: The kitsune bear ears on the top of their head similar to a fox's, as well as a very bushy and long tail. They magically grow another tail every 40 years of their lifespan, starting off with one tail. The maximum amount of tails a kitsune may have is 6, but 5 is the most common due to their average lifespan. The kitsune also have exceptional aging when they biologically become an adult. They age the same rate as most species, but when they reach their adulthood at the age of 20, their aging begins to slow down.
